War Maker
=========

War Maker is a cross-platform desktop video game written in Java. The game was
developed for Ludum Dare 41 (https://ldjam.com/) in approximately 72 hours. The
theme of the jam was combining 2 incompatible genres. The game certainly follows
the theme, as it is a spin on the classic tower defense genre, where you, the
player, control both sides.

Game Synopsis
-------------

War. The world is engulfed by it. Millions have died. Millions more will starve
or be killed. The global economy is in ruins. The last remaining nations on
Earth have divided themselves into 2 opposing sides, each bound by ideology to
conquer the other. Redania fights for law and order. Bluezbekistan fights for
liberty. Many predict this will be the war to end all wars...

...which would be terrible for business! As the newest sales recruit for Freedom
and Piece, Inc., the only remaining arms dealer and defense contractor large
enough to supply both sides, you have been tasked with preserving the power
equilibrium between Redania and Bluezbekistan through strategic pricing and
contract negotiation. You are the military industrial complex's last line of
defense. Now go, prolong the war, and secure this company's financial future!

And remember our company motto: Having freedom, means having a piece!
